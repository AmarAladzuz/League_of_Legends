### Overview

League of Legends (LoL) is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play.

Dataset contains info about 184070 League of Legends ranked solo games (matches, player and team stats, bans), spanning across several years. For this project I used SQL to analyze the data and find some insights.
