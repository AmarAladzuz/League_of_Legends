# League of Legends project

Data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paololol/league-of-legends-ranked-matches


Dataset contains info about 184070 League of Legends ranked solo games (matches, player and team stats, bans), spanning across several years. For this project I used SQL to analyze the data and find some insights.
